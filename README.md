# Address-Manager
server for Address-Manager-UI


Extract the test.zip to location C:\test for this work.
This is a dummy verimove proj. We are reading a input address file generated after user adds a new address to his address list.
It matches this address against a input file that contains the moved addresses data. 
If the customer matches then it generates a ouput file which will then be ready by server to add a entry to moved address master list.
